##  Development only! Autoreloads on code changes and gives meaningful error
##  messages, but allows code execution and should not be use in production.
DEBUG = True

##  List here modules from app/ directory (subdirectories that start with mod_)
##  that you want to enable.
MODULES = [
    "mod_boards"
]

##  Server name should be specified as both domain and port, e.g. for Flask's
##  built-in webserver that would be:
##
# SERVER_NAME = 'localhost:5000'
##
##  Note, that you can't use subdomains with localhost, so to test them during
##  development you'd need to put:
##
## '127.0.0.1 name.tld api.name.tld'
##
##  into /etc/hosts and then specify here:
##
# SERVER_NAME = 'name.tld'
# API_SUBDOMAIN = 'api'
##
##  None means all domain names are good (subdomains won't work, obviously).
SERVER_NAME = None
API_SUBDOMAIN = ''

##  All mod_api routes will start with this prefix. Especially useful when
##  *not* using dedicated subdomain for API.
API_PREFIX = '/api'
